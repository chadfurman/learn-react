## What is React?
React is a way to build web pages!  It uses JavaScript and lets you organize your page into "components" -- this has lots of benefits.  The components can be interacted with; that is to say, they can change and remember their "state".  You can also compose components, which is a fancy way of saying you can put one component inside another.

All of this means that you have a clean way of building really complex web applications -- no wonder React is called a "Modern JavaScript Framework" and is used by most major web applications!

## Pre-requisites
This is a primer on React.  We assume you have some basic HTML, CSS, and knowledge.  The following is useful information which will help you get a lot more out of this:

* what is a div, a script tag, etc.
* What is an id and how is it different from a class name
* how to change the background color of an element
* what is an event handler (i.e. onClick) and how do you create one in JavaScript
* what is a variable / what does `const` and `let` do
* What is an array and how do you create an array in JavaScript
* What is a function

You can proceed if you don't know the above -- if anything you don't understand comes up or you want to learn more:

## Overview

We will:
1. Start with some basic stuff like making an element and loading it onto a webpage
2. Talk about React's fancy "JSX" -- an extension to JavaScript that makes this kind of stuff easier
3. Introduce the quickest way of making a professional React application -- the "create-react-app" command-line tool
4. Make some basic changes to the main "App" class component, like text and images
5. Talk about "state", "hooks", and add a hook to the App component so we can use state
6. Add an event handler which will change our state
7. Create a child component which is "controlled" by the parent component
8. Talk about "css-in-js" by using the "styled-components" library
9. Add a form element for user input
10. Introduce "conditional" rendering -- showing or hiding elements based on a condition
11. Creating multiple elements using "lists", "keys", and "map"
12. Where you can go to learn more
