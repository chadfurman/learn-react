The first step is to make a basic webpage, load the React library, and add a React element
1. Make a file called index.html and give it an html and body tag
2. Follow the steps in https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-react-in-one-minute
- step1: Add a div with an ID to the page
- step2: Add all three script tags just before the closing body tag
